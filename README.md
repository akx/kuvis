Upload images, show them.

Not meant to be secure, just a simple way to upload images with associated metadata and show them.

## Usage

- Set up a Python virtualenv
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `flask run` (see `flask --help` for options)
  - or use some other WSGI server, but this should do for minor deployments.
